Gilbert's Wood-Fired Steaks & Seafood is an upscale restaurant known for its stellar service, cozy bar scene, quality cuts of beef and exceptional seafood preparations. Gilbert's Fresh - where freshness is everything. Gilbert's consistently offers great quality fresh produced, sourced locally wherever possible. Since opening Salâs Gilbert Pizza in 2006, Sal and Grace have brought the freshness of homemade Italian foods and the taste of New York to Gilbert. Add a combination of six 500ml Gilbertâs Cold-Pressed Juice bottles, 3 x Booster and 3 x Greenade, to your catering order. The Cheeses are gone from the display...cabinet and instead its a smaller range of Cheeses all vacuum packed only in a Fridge. While we are renowned for our old school values and delivering the freshest and best value local produce to our customers, there is so much more on offer! Locally owned and operated, we are onsite every day handling everything from fresh produce to hand selected meats ensuring quality so you can enjoy our heirloom family recipes.
